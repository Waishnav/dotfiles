## Important Notes 


## Workflow & keybindings
I feel one of the greatest USP (Unique Selling Point) of the linux is customizablity of workflow... You can make your computer look and work exactly the way you want...
I've used Windows in the past, the workflow was not that great as that of Linux provides. Like its just headach if there are more than 4 apps are opened I don't think its productive at all... 
Even if you are using Ubuntu the same things happens. Bruh
Thats where the linux ricing helps..
right now my life so pleased after a 2 months or so using my rice you can't even Imagine! Now I can say to windows user "May God mercy on yours Soul" 

this is how my desktop look like and this is how it works...
- I use 6 workspaces (use mostly 5 anyway). Each workspaces is define for certain things like workspace-1 is define for development related stuffs, whereas workspace-2 contains only Brave browser all the time..
- similarly workspace-3 designing related stuffs (like Inkscape, PhotoGimp)
- workspace-4 music
- workspace-5 Discord n Reddit n Telegram
- workspace-6 Mystery box (things that I use rarely like watching Movies or web-series)

workspace-4 music

workspace-5 Discord n Reddit n Telegram

workspace-6 Mystery box (things that I use rarely like watching Movies or web-series)

At this moment I am so used to whenever I want to use browser my hands just go to `SUPER + 2` and boom there we go...

Obivously you can modify this workspaces the way you want like If you want make another workspace devoted for taking notes you can simple

These are the basic keybinds. Read through the `sxhkd/sxhkdrc` file for more keybinds like increasing/decreasing size of window in floating mode

|        Keybind           |                 Function                 |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `Super + alt + T`        | Launch terminal (kitty)                  |
| `Super + alt + B`        | Launch Brave                             |
| `Super + W`              | Close window                             |
| `Super + Space`          | Open rofi menu                           |
| `Super + H/J/K/L`        | Navigate through windows                 |
| `Super + Shift + T/W`    | Switch through layouts (tall,wide}       |
| `Super + Ctrl +T`        | Make a floating window tiled             |
| `Super + Ctrl + F`       | Make a tiled window floating             |
| `Super + 1/2/3/4/5/6`    | Switch the Workspaces                    |
| `Super + T/W`            | Switch to the Tall/Wide layout           |

Note: 1. `Super` refers to the `Win` key.

Note: 2. I used to the keybindings to close tab in browser `ctrl + w` thats why I use `Super + w` to close any window
