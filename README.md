## Workflow & keybindings


These are the basic keybinds. Read through the `sxhkd/sxhkdrc` file for more keybinds like increasing/decreasing size of window in floating mode

|        Keybind           |                 Function                 |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `Super + alt + t`        | Launch terminal (kitty)                  |
| `Super + W`              | Close window                             |
| `Super + Space`          | Open rofi menu                           |
| `Super + H,J,K,L`        | Navigate through windows                 |
| `Super + Shift + T,W`    | Switch through layouts (tall,wide}       |
| `Super + T`              | Make a floating window tiled             |
| `Super + F`              | Make a tiled window floating             |
| `Super + 1,2,3,4,5,6,7`  | Switch the Workspaces                    |
| `Super + alt + `

Note: 1. `Super` refers to the `Win` key.

Note: 2. I used to the keybindings to close tab in browser `ctrl + w` thats why I use `Super + w` to close any window
